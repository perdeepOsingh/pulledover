                <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
                <p>A lot of people very close to me, especially women of color, are legitimately afraid of what might
                    happen if they were pulled over by the police in the United States.</p>
                <p>While I have no intention of suggesting that every law enforcement officer has malicious intent, it
                    is very true that history shows this fear is legitimate. It is my hope that this tool can be a first
                    step towards ensuring that interactions between police and traditionally disadvantaged people groups
                    will end well.</p>
                <p><strong>Is this legal?</strong> Probably. While I can't make any guarantees of legality (each user is
                    responsible for ensuring the legality of recording in their particular situation), you should be OK
                    using PulledOver. However, if you are in Illinois or Massachusetts, you are required to ask for the
                    police officer's consent before you record (<a

                    If you are in California, <a href="http://www.ehlinelaw.com/civil-rights/filming-police-legal/">the
                        law</a> is a bit vague so your safest option is to ask for consent.</p>

                <h2>The future of <strong>Pulled Over</strong></h2>
                <p><strong>How is this free?</strong> Right now I'm covering all costs out of pocket because I believe
                    it's the right thing to do. If the service is abused I may have to shut it down. If it gets
                    legitimately popular I may seek sponsorship from like-minded people (not advertisers, but people who
                    care about civil liberties).</li>
                <p><strong>How can I help?</strong> If PulledOver has helped you or you believe in this idea, you can <a
                            href="{{ route('donate') }}">donate</a>. I would love to add a full, simple mobile
                    application that works without the phone call&mdash;capturing audio, geographic coordinates,
                    notifying family, friends, and perhaps even social media.</p>
                <p>If you're a coder, you can contribute on <a
                            href="http://github.com/mattstauffer/pulledover">GitHub</a> (or if you're a mobile
                    developer, message me at <a href="http://twitter.com/stauffermatt">@stauffermatt</a>).</p>
